# Neural Networks

In ```NeuralNetwork.py```, a simple neural network with stochastic gradient descent and sigmoid activation is implemented.  It can be initialized using random Gaussian distribution or with all zeros.</br>

To run a 3-layer neural network on bank note dataset, run the ```run_bank_note_NN.py``` file.</br>

In ```run_banknote_tf.py```, neural networks were built using Tensorflow and Keras. Two activation functions: tanh and RELU, are used to build neural networks with various width and depth.</br>

Run the ```run_banknote_tf.py``` file to apply tensorflow-implemented neural networks on bank note dataset. Training and test errors are reported in ```tanh_output.txt``` and ```relu_output.txt```.
