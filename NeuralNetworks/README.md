# Neural Networks

In ```SVM.py```, 3 versions of SVM algorithms are implemented: SVM primal with stochastic gradient descent, SVM dual and SVM with kernal.</br>

To run SVM on bank note dataset, run the ```run_bank_note_svm.py``` file.</br>

In ```NN_tf.py```, neural networks were built using Tensorflow and Keras. Two activation functions: tanh and RELU, are used to build neural networks with various width and depth.</br>

Run the ```NN_tf.py``` file to run tensorflow-implemented neural networks on bank not dataset. Training and test errors are reported in ```tanh_output.txt``` and ```relu_output.txt```.
