# Ensemble Learning

Three ensemble learning algorithms are implemented.

## AdaBoost
AdaBoost is implemented in ```Ada.py```<br />
To run AdaBoost on bank data set, run ```run_bank_Ada.py```<br />
## Bagging
Bagging is implemented in ```Bagging.py```<br />
To run AdaBoost on bank data set, run ```run_bank_Bagging.py```<br />
## Random Forest
Random Forest is implemented in ```RandomForest.py```<br />
To run Random Forest on bank data set, run ```run_bank_RF.py```<br />
