# ml_lib

This is a light weight machine learning library I implemented from scratch.

The library contains following machine learning algorithms:

## [Decision Tree](https://github.com/zltc1206/ML_lib/tree/master/DecisionTree)<br>
The ID3 Decision Tree algorithm is implemented in ```ID3.py```.

## [Ensemble Learning](https://github.com/zltc1206/ML_lib/tree/master/EnsembleLearning)<br>
The AdaBoost algorithm is implemented in ```Ada.py```;<br>
The Bagging algorithm is implemented in ```Bagging.py```;<br>
The Random Forrest algorithm is implemented in ```RandomForest.py```.

## [Linear Regression](https://github.com/zltc1206/ML_lib/tree/master/LinearRegression)<br>
2 linear regression algorithms are implemented in ```LMS.py```:
- Batch gradient descent
- Stochastic gradient descent

## [Perceptron](https://github.com/zltc1206/ML_lib/tree/master/Perceptron)<br>
3 Perceptron algorithms are implemented in ```Perceptron.py```:
- Standard Perceptron
- Voted Perceptron
- Average Perceptron

## [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/zltc1206/ML_lib/tree/master/SVM)<br>
3 Support Vector Machine algorithms are implemented in ```SVM.py```:
- SVM primal with stochastic gradient descent
- SVM dual
- SVM with kernal

## [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/zltc1206/ML_lib/tree/master/LogisticRegression)<br>
2 versions of Logistic Regression algorithms are implemented in ```LogisticRegression.py```, both with stochastic gradient descent:
- Logistic Regression with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)
- Logistic Regression with maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP)

## [Neural Network](https://github.com/zltc1206/ML_lib/tree/master/NeuralNetworks)<br>
A simple neural network with stochastic gradient descent and sigmoid activation is implemented in ```NeuralNetwork.py```.<br>
