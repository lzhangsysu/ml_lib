# Logistic Regression

In ```LogisticRegression.py```, 2 versions of logistic regression algorithms with stochastic gradient descent are implemented: logistic regression with maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and logistic gradient descent with maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP).</br>

To run logistic regression on bank note dataset, run the ```run_bank_note_log.py``` file.
